# To-Do-List

A currency converter application that uses the https://exchangeratesapi.io/ API to pull JSON data on the different currency exchange rates and allows the user to enter a value and the base currency, and have it convertered to a selected currency

## Instructions

Select your base currency from the dropdown at the top, then enter a number. Then select the currency you wish it to be converted to at the bottom dropdown menu. By default both dropdowns will be set to CAD so it will need to be changed by the user.
